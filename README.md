# Game about cars, developed to teach myself advanced Unreal 4
Head to head, car on car, split-screen battle, with simple AI and advanced control systems in Unreal 4
***
This is part of section 4 of the Unreal C++ course on Udemy taught by Ben Tristem. The section is called Battle Tanks. I am not a huge fan of tanks so I will challange myself and make it into cars instead.
